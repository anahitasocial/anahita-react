## Participating in the Groups and Projects

**Be nice** - Be courteous and polite to Anahita website members.

**Keep it clean** - Keep the language clean (no swearing)

**Be helpful** - Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.

**Stay calm** - The written word is always subject to interpretation, so give people the benefit of the doubt and try not to let emotions get out of control.

**Stay Legal** - Do not discuss illegal activities. Our server is hosted in the USA and so is subject to US law. Please do not expose us to any unnecessary legal liability.

**Stay relevant** - post your content in the relevant group or project.

**Start your own topic** - Do not hijack other people's topics.

**No useless posts** - This includes: Thread bumping, useless one liners, Flamewars, Trolling and Spamming.

**Use your own words** - If you wish to use the words of somebody else, quote them, citing the source. Plagiarism is unethical and is illegal in many countries.

**Do not shame anybody** - This is not the place to settle a commercial disagreement for custom development or to be a 'wall of shame'. Any posts deemed to be of this nature will be removed. Settle your disputes in private please.

**Don't spam** - If we see your promotional material on many locations that is considered spamming. Do it on your own profile. If people like it, they'll follow you by choice.

## Asking For Help

Use a descriptive and unique subject line rather than "HELP ME" or "How do I do this?"

Include as much information as you can. Nobody can help you without sufficient information.

Acknowledge and thank those who help you.

Share your knowledge with others whenever you can.

## Interaction with the Anahita Core Team

**No questions or bug reports on their profiles** - Do not post support questions and bug reports on the core team's profiles. Use the groups and projects for that purpose instead.

**They have the right to privacy** - The core team can choose not to answer a question.

**Do Not Manipulate** - Feel free to make constructive suggestions and recommendations, but do not try to manipulate the core team into developing your favorite features into any of the Anahita products.

**You are responsible for your own deadlines** - The core team is not responsible for your project deadlines. Plan your projects based on the existing features provided in the Anahita software or be reasonable if you are planning to use some of the features in the upcoming releases of Anahita.

**No support questions in the Project groups** - Project groups are dedicated to discussions and updates about the Anahita project itself. please use the Tribe Support group for your support related questions.

## Reporting Bugs

Report bugs in the most relevant project or group.

Do provide step by step instructions so the core team can reproduce the bug.

Be very descriptive. Let us know what browser type, browser version, server configuration, php version, etc. you are using. Provide any information that you think might be useful.

Please do not express frustration, anger, or sarcasm in your bug reports. They provide very little help to resolve the issue.
